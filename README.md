# Clustering Antartica Penguin Species
**Origin of this data** : Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

**The dataset consists of 5 columns.**

- culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
- culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
- flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
- body_mass_g: body mass (g)
- sex: penguin sex

Unfortunately, they have not been able to record the species of penguin, but they know that there are three species that are native to the region: **Adelie**, **Chinstrap**, and **Gentoo**, so your task is to apply your data science skills to help them identify groups in the dataset!
